# Playwright API Automation Testing

This repository contains API automation tests written using **Playwright Test**.  
It demonstrates how to perform **GET, POST, and authenticated API calls** with various public APIs.

## Project Overview

This project automates multiple API endpoints from several demo APIs:
- Ecommerce API — `https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1`
- Dummy JSON Auth API — `https://dummyjson.com`
- Pokémon API — `https://pokeapi.co`
- USGS Earthquake API — `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/`
- Simple Books API — `https://simple-books-api.click`

The purpose of this project is to:
- Learn **API automation** with Playwright.
- Handle **authentication tokens (JWT)**.
- Work with **query parameters**, **status assertions**, and **response validations**.
- Structure tests clearly in Playwright (grouping, setup, teardown).

## Tech Stack

- **Playwright** — for API and UI testing  
- **Node.js** — JavaScript runtime  
- **Playwright Test** — assertion and test runner  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — scripting language
